In this paper, mExamining and protecting air quality has become one of the most essential
activities for the government in many industrial and urban areas today. The meteorological and 
traffic factors, burning of fossil fuels, and industrial parameters play significant roles in
air pollution.With this increasing air pollution,We Are in need of implementing models which
will record information about concentrations of air pollutants(so2,no2,etc).The deposition of
this harmful gases in the air is affecting the quality of peopleâ€™s lives, especially in urban
areas. Lately, many researchers began to use Big Data Analytics approach as there are 
environmental sensing networks and sensor data available.
achine learning techniques are used to predict the concentration of so2 in the environment. 
Sulphur dioxide irritates the skin and mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs.
Models in time series are employed to predict the so2 readings in nearing years or months.
